# PyHack
I am building a Payroll application in Python. This application contains a GUI which has Labels and fields for the Employee's ID, Name, Hourly Salary and Number of Hours worked during the week. The application will calculate them including a tax rate of 20% and would result in a display which will show your weekly salary.
