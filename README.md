# PyHack
Developed a Wage Calculator application in Python. This application contains a GUI which has Labels and fields for the Employee's ID, Name, Hourly Salary and Number of Hours worked during the week. The application will calculate them including a tax rate of 20% and would result in a display which will show your weekly salary. 

Technicality: 
Challenges during the Process 
- Creating a GUI with MVC for the application
- Decision: Make the Python GUI application without the use of MVC design pattern
- Logic of findong out the Weekly Payroll for an Employee
- Creating the application with button, Labels and fields. 

Practicality:
- This project can be used by employees to have a rough estimate of weekly pay. 
- This can be a Real World Application as all employees who work an hourly wage could use the application to determine pay. 

Creativity: 
- WOW Factor: Employee's ease of mind
